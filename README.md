# Blog App by Nestjs and angular
A simple blog project with NestJS and Angular. The frontend and webend codes are located in separate directories.

**note: Of course, it would be better to use nx to have a better monorepo. I wanted to just develop it slowly, but then I decided to do the front end of this project as well**
